# FinTech Financial Planning Using Monte Carlo Simulations and API's

*A FinTech project to analyze crytocurrencies with 'CryVesto for your Portfolio'*

## Background
This project is for a fintech startup serving as a crypto consulting and research firm. This part of the project's application utilizes a Monte Carlo Simulation app projecting returns based on analysis of major equity and fixed income asset classes with and without cryptocurrency for comparison purposes, as a viable alternate class of investment.   

Setting up this part of the analysis consideration was given to the major asset classes in constructing a portfolio with cryptocurrencies as an alternate investment. Traditionally the 3 major classes are equities(stocks), fixed income(bonds), and cash or its equivalents like money market funds. For the purpose of this analysis after utilizing the Fama-French regression model, the major asset classes are identified with the selection of ETFs. For this part of the program, consideration is given to separate the equities class into sub-classes using major equity indexes to reflect diversification and differing risk/return characteristics. Special consideration is given to a popular aggressive growth ETF composed mostly of high risk start-ups with innovative technology. An addition is given to bonds as it is the traditional asset of stability, low risk and liquidity for balancing a portfolios risk/returns over the long term. Overtime we want to observe how each asset class performs differently in prevailing market conditions, and under certain economic events with cryptocurrency in a portfolio. 

The major equities markets are the S&P 500, NASADQ 100, Russell 2000, and S&P 500 Value Index represented by the following ETFs: SPY, QQQ, VTWO, RPV respectively. Special consideration is ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), with added traditional asset of low risk, stability and liquidity is Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF(BND). And most importantly for our analysis Bitcoin Strategy ETF(BITO). Theses are selected to emulate key models of benchmark indexes and key asset themes for portfolio allocation, identify asset risks and comparison purposes. 

This app makes assumptions by assets classes in comparison with major indexes using initial investment of $10,000 without a porfolio of crypto currency using stocks and bond indexes classified by asset class. Including cryptocurrency in portfolio the NASDAQ 100 index ETF QQQ was ommitted to avoid a repeat of asset class overlap in summary metrics. Reason behind this is that the FANG stocks comprise 33% of NASDAQ market capitalization and technology stocks added comprise over 50% market cap of the index. In the S&P 500 by comparison, FANG holds 19% and 28% respectively. Observing that QQQ has similar summary statistics with VTWO, but a higher mean metric inline with S&P 500, QQQ ETF is ommitted for greater asset class separation in the portolio. As such QQQ ETF is ommitted in the portfolio weighting of portfoli_data of etf_aggr_prices for the MCSimulator. For the the same reason it is ommitted from portfolio_data of etf_crypto_prices. 

This app within the 'CryVesto' program utilizes an Alpaca API to get historical closing prices for various stock asset classes and a bond index(AGG) against alternate investment ideas with ARKK and BITO ETFs to simulate future market returns in a portfolio. Weâ€™ll run a Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 samples to forecast the portfolio performance of 1 year, as well as different porfolio ratios(weighting) of stock and bond returns as a constant before comparing alternate asset classes of hi-Tech aggressive growth and crypto currency itself. This should help members with assessing risks at 95 percent confidence level when changing portfolio stock/bond weighting and time periods to meet goals.

The data and chart visualations should help 'Investors' consider porfolio funding options using cryptocurrency as an alternate invesment.  

Utilizing the Fama-French Regression analysis followed by the Monte Carlo Simulator to forcast and calculate risk/return overtime, these steps can assist with 95-percent confidence of the results in making a determination of how much weight to place on Bitcoin investments in a portfolio to attain financial planning goals.

## Technologies

The software operates on python 3.9 with the installation package imports embedded with Anaconda3 installation and MCSimulation module obtained from MCForecastTools:

* [anaconda3](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/e) .

* [MCForecastTools.py](https://cdn.inst-fs-pdx-prod.inscloudgate.net/e0e08ad7-c5b3-43c1-8e7c-e7efc5f1f39c/MCForecastTools.py?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImNkbiJ9.eyJyZXNvdXJjZSI6Ii9lMGUwOGFkNy1jNWIzLTQzYzEtOGU3Yy1lN2VmYzVmMWYzOWMvTUNGb3JlY2FzdFRvb2xzLnB5IiwidGVuYW50IjoiY2FudmFzIiwidXNlcl9pZCI6IjE1MDQyMDAwMDAwMDAxODE0MiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MDgzNzk1OSwiZXhwIjoxNjUwOTI0MzU5fQ.VVAZTpXzX9mBx6vnKocyZoIxDBXzM4T-fZ3x9YAxzvjvID_OarmksBCAVMdjKJ8v8i_Ga8KoGLhBGqvfT44IoA&content_type=text%2Fx-python) .

## Installation Guide

Before running the applications first activate the Conda development environment and launch JupyterLab to import the following required libraries apps. 

```python libraries

import os
import json
import requests
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi
from MCForecastTools import MCSimulation 
%matplotlib inline 
```

# Usage

This application is launched from web-based JupyterLab utilizing Pandas which is designed for data analysis to write and read code in an IDE and review results through the Python libraries. The Anaconda3 software application includes the Pandas libraries; **os, requests, json, load_dotenv, alpaca_trade_api, MCSimulation,%matplotlib inline** to utilize data frames, forecast through simulations and plot charts in an integrated Conda development environment. 

Importantly download the Alpaca API key and secret keys from *https://app.alpaca.markets/brokerage/new-account* to save in a *.env* file. It functions for holding api keys to access Alpaca API market data SDK. To use *.env* functionality **import os** and **import load_dotenv** are required to call the **load_dotenv()** function.

The program is developed in Jupyter notebooks on a **.ipny** file.  The pandas imports help the imports of **os, requests, json, load_dotenv** retrieve data from remote API's, and load them in your computor within a data frame to visualize and analyze. The JSON library is needed to work with files in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format for API requests and interface with your machine. Using **numpy** library tools facilitates math calculations with large quantities of data sets to get: daily returns, risk and return metrics, standard deviation, and beta. The Pandas **%matplotlib inline** enables functions to create informative visualizations from the Pandas DataFrames and data metrics. The **import alpaca_trade_api** is required to retreive data for stock and bond simulations. The **MCSimulation** app is required to running the Monte Carlo simulation program.   

Finally the **CrVesto_ForeCast.ipynb**  program on this part of the CryVesto team project utilizes the above libraries to perform several steps in retrieving, creating, evaluating, analyzing data in order to make forcasts with cryptocurrencies focussing on Bitcoin for portfolio analysis planning . Utilizing the Fama-French Regression analysis with the Monte Carlo Simulator to calculate risk/return overtime, these steps can assist with 95-percent confidence of the results in making a determination of how much weight to place on Bitcoin investments in a portfolio to attain financial planning goals.
