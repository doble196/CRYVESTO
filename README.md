# Cryvesto CLI Application

This application allows a user to build a portfolio by selecting upto 2 cryptos and upto 3 ETFs from the lists provided. The user gets to put in the weightage of each in the portfoilio.

It then does a four factor analysis on the cryptos, followed by Betas and Sharpe Ratios. And, finally does a Montecarlo simulation projecting the returns based upon the portfolio constructed.

## How to Run the Application

The code requires myapi.env, which is there. you may change it to your API keys. It currently used my API keys, which might work for now. 

I will remove the API Keys from the final code. 

After cloning the code, 
    - $ cd Project-1
    - $ python mailine.py
