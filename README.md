# Project_1


The correlation between stocks and cryptocurrency has been increasing since 2020; now both crypto and US equities appear to be moving in tandem. We hypothesize that crypto prices are currently an indicator for the tech-heavy, growth-heavy Nasdaq 100, and to a lesser extent, are even correlated with value stocks (at the opposite end of the equity spectrum). Likewise, cryptocurrencies appear to be highly correlated with one another. We hypothesize that the idea of "cryptodiversification” does not exist, or does so minimally.

For this project, we plan to analyze where cryptocurrency belongs in a portfolio, including how to balance it against equities (growth, value) and how to “cryptodiversify” within a portfolio. We will investigate our hypotheses with data aggregation and a number of plots for visualizing covariance, beta, and correlation. Further, as an intro to cryptocurrencies and to our analysis, we plan to develop a user-interactive interface that allows a user to select various cryptocurrencies, cull relevant news for a selected coin, and view pricing charts. We plan to build-out this app in projects to come.
