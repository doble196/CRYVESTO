# Cryvesto

The correlation between stocks and cryptocurrencies has been steadily increasing over the past few years; now both crypto and US equities appear to be moving in tandem. We hypothesize that cryptocurrencies are increasingly becoming exposed to risk factors of the S&P 500. 

Likewise, cryptocurrencies appear to be highly correlated with one another. We hypothesize that the idea of "crypto-diversification” does not exist, or does so minimally.

We have investigated our hypotheses and analyzed where cryptocurrency belongs in a portfolio, including how to balance it against equities (growth, value) and how to “crypto-diversify” within a portfolio. 

Further, as an intro to cryptocurrencies and to our analysis, we have begun development of a user-interactive interface that allows a user to build a portfolio including Cryptos and certain ETFs.
